Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
=> From the diagram the Web service instance has no security group attached . The security group acts as a firewall that permits traffic from a certain protocol, port and IP. Here we want traffic only from the load balancer.
# Poor practice 2
=> From the steps, we skipped the creation of a new user with specific permissions for the given task.
