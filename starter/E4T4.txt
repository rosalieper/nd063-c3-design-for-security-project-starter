We could move the web application instance to the private subnet and use a nat gateway for communication between the application and the world.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No. VPC CIDR blocks can be overlapping or identical, which may lead to unexpected results. We should use a route tables to control which instances can access resources in Amazon S3 via the endpoint.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
NO. To encrypt your existing Amazon S3 objects, you can use Amazon S3 Batch Operations. You provide S3 Batch Operations with a list of objects to operate on, and Batch Operations calls the respective API to perform the specified operation.
